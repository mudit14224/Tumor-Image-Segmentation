        <h1>What to know about MRI scans</h1>
        <p><i>A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is a common procedure around the world.</i></p>
        <p>MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the organs and tissues within the body.</p>
        <p>Since its invention, doctors and researchers continue to refine MRI techniques to
             assist in medical procedures and research. The development of MRI revolutionized medicine.</p>

        <h1>What is an MRI scan?</h1>
        <p>An MRI scan uses a large magnet, 
            radio waves, and a computer to create a detailed, cross-sectional image of internal organs and structures.
            <br><br>
            The scanner itself typically resembles a large tube with a table in the middle, allowing the patient to slide in.
            An MRI scan differs from CT scans and X-rays, as it does not use potentially harmful ionizing radiation.</p>

        <h1>Uses of MRI</h1>
        <p>The development of the MRI scan represents a huge milestone for the medical world.
            <br><br>

            Doctors, scientists, and researchers are now able to examine the inside of 
            the human body in high detail using a non-invasive tool.

        <h1>MRI Segmentation of the Human Brain</h1>

        <p>Image segmentation is one of the most important tasks in medical image analysis and is often 
            the first and the most critical step in many clinical applications. 
            In brain MRI analysis, image segmentation is commonly used for measuring and visualizing the 
            brainâ€™s anatomical structures, for analyzing brain changes, for delineating pathological regions, 
            and for surgical planning and image-guided interventions.
        </p>
        <p>MRI image segmentation is a challenging task because of the similarity 
            between different tissue structures in the brain image. 
            Also the number of homogeneous regions present in an image 
            varies with the image slice and orientation.
